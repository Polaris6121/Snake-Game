# Snake-Game
This is the snake game which I made from python programming using turtle method 
I will give a detail explanation for the code and how it work











First We will be importing modules into the program and giving default values for the game
         import turtle
         import time
         import random
              delay = 0.1
               score = 0
               high_score = 0
Secondly We will create a window screen for the game where we will create the head of the snake and food for the snake in the game and displaying the scores at the header of the 
game
